Linking CSS File:
1.To link a CSS file to an HTML document, use the <link> tag inside the <head> section.
2.Set the rel attribute to "stylesheet" to indicate that this link is for a stylesheet.
3.Use the href attribute to specify the path to the CSS file. In this case, it's "style.css".
4.This allows the HTML document to access and apply the styles defined in the linked CSS file.

Linking Script File:
1.To link a JavaScript file to an HTML document, use the <script> tag.
2.Place the <script> tag typically before the closing </body> tag to ensure that the JavaScript code is loaded after the HTML content.
3.Use the src attribute to specify the path to the JavaScript file. In this case, it's "script.js".
4.This allows the HTML document to access and execute the JavaScript code defined in the linked script file.
